This is the software side of my as-yet-untitled, custom architecture, pipelined 8-bit CPU project.
Its instruction set is heavily based on the Intel 8080, with additional inspiration from the 65c02.
I'm hoping to be code-compatible, maybe even binary-compatible, with the 8080.

No hardware exists yet, but I've begun building out my toolchain along with a digital
simulation to verify the design.

This software will be responsible for creating the CPU microcode, and eventually will also include an
assembler to compile software that will run on the 8-bit computer.

Still in early stages.
