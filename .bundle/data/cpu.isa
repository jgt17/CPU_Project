# Describes the instruction set of the cpu
# Format is:

[Metadata]
isa_name = my_cpu_1
word_size = 8
max_args = 2

[Groups]
# opcode specified assumes group bits replaced with 0's
# specify which bits are group bits by following opcode with, eg ", 01DDDSSS"
# group args replaced by the associated value
# eg, the entry for the set of instructions for moving data between registers would look like
# \x40, 01DDDSSS = mov {r1}, {r2}
# and would be interpreted as
# \x40 = mov b, b
# \x41 = mov b, c
# etc
# {} indicates a grouping arg, [] indicates an arg to the opcode itself
# (something that would be an extra byte in the instruction)
# note that the first group in the opcode encoding is assumed to be associated with the first arg

[Expansion Opcodes]
# opcodes reserved for expanding the instruction set
# expansion opcodes also support grouping, in both the regular and expanded opcode
# [opcode] = [# args the instructions under the opcode expect] # need to know num args for stage 0

[Instructions]

\x40: 01DDDSSS = mov {r1}, {r2}     # move the contents of r2 to r1
